## Known Issues & Decisions

### Issues
- None yet

### Decisions
- **PixiJS vs Canvas**: Using PixiJS with @pixi/react for WebGL-accelerated rendering and React integration
- **Technology**: @pixi/react provides declarative components (Stage, Container, Graphics, Text)
- **Layout Algorithm**: Using backend's column assignment, adding visual positioning
- **Colors**: PixiJS uses hex numbers (0xRRGGBB) not CSS strings
- **Diff Viewer**: May need new IPC handler for file diffs
